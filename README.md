This project demonstrates how to:
- Import CSV data into an SQLite database using Python.
- Run SQL queries for aggregation and analysis.
- Use Python libraries for visualization and extracting insights.
It’s a simple yet powerful workflow for handling structured data and generating meaningful results.

 Tech Stack
- Python (data processing & visualization)
- SQLite (lightweight relational database)
- Pandas (CSV handling & data manipulation)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualizations)
- SQL (aggregation queries)

- Steps Performed
- Data Import
- Loaded CSV file into SQLite using Python (sqlite3 + pandas).
- Database Setup
- Created tables and inserted records.
- Aggregation Queries
- Ran SQL queries for:
- Summaries (e.g., totals, averages).
- Grouped insights (e.g., by category/date).
- Visualization
- - Plotted charts (bar, line, pie) using Matplotlib/Seaborn.
- Highlighted key insights from the data.


Future Improvements
- Automate CSV ingestion for multiple files.
- Add interactive dashboards (e.g., Plotly).
- Integrate with larger databases (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
